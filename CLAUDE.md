# CLAUDE.md

This repo is the NHL Model 3.0 site served at https://ideareels.io
(it replaced the former IdeaReels startup-idea product; that code is in git history
before the "Replace IdeaReels with NHL Model 3.0" commit).

## Canonical locations

- Local repo: `/Users/vincent/.openclaw/workspace/projects/idea-wheel`
- GitHub: `https://github.com/vincentploum-cmyk/idea-wheel`
- Production: `https://ideareels.io` (Cloudflare in front)
- Hosting: Render web service, auto-builds from GitHub `main` (`render.yaml`)
- Model source of truth for new logic: `~/Desktop/NHL/nhl-project/nhl-predictor/src/App.jsx`

## Workflow

1. Edit files in this repo.
2. `npm test` and `npm run build`.
3. Check `/` at 1440 and 390 widths (landing signed out; workbench via
   `NHL_DEV_USER_EMAIL=... NHL_STORE_DRIVER=fs npm run dev`).
4. Commit, push `main`; Render deploys in ~2-3 min. CI smoke checks `/`, `/auth/login`,
   `/api/health` (commit match) and that `/api/nhl/runs` returns 401 when signed out.

## Automation

- `lib/nhl-data/*` pulls NHL API data into Supabase Storage and builds the model's
  input workbooks in the model's existing formats. Never change the model's
  parsers to fit the automation; change the builders instead.
- Scheduled by `.github/workflows/nhl-data.yml` (daily results + lineups) and
  `nhl-lineups.yml` (hourly pre-game lineup reads); Mac folder sync in `tools/mac-sync`.
- Signed-in page = five hash tabs (`#teams`, `#matchups`, `#model`, `#league`, `#history`); it opens on
  Matchups. The stored data (rosters, media, game history, league, MoneyPuck) is kept fresh by the
  morning run and shown, with repair buttons and the backfill, under Best bets → "Data sources"
  (`/api/nhl/data/setup`); there is no setup tab.
  Positions are captured per game from the newest lineup dated at or before it
  (`lib/nhl-data/positions.js`, `data/positions/<date>.json`; nothing is frozen: every read
  re-captures every game, a tweet posted more than 4 hours after puck drop belongs to the next
  game (`gdtCutoffs`), and games never snapshotted get the NHL.com preview at ingest). Stored
  box scores follow the latest read: `restampPositions` (after every lineup read, `ingestGames`
  with nothing new, `?only=restamp`) rewrites the day's games and season rows when a position or
  line changed; the morning run settles yesterday first (`ingestLineups(…, { settle: true })`,
  `?only=settle`) and posted GameDayTweets pages also settle the previous day's games
  (`settleGdtPages`). The stored skater rows carry the position plus its source (`posSrc`,
  `boxPos`) and the line slot (`line`: forward line 1-4 or defense pair 1-3, null for a
  box-score position), so results are logged per line (LW1, LW2, LW3 …; `defenseBySlot` in
  `lib/nhl-data/defense.js`, `slots` in `/api/nhl/data/defense`). Each game record carries its
  first goal (`firstGoal`, scorer's row flagged `fg`; shootouts excluded) and `firstGoalsAllowed`
  reads first goals given up per defending team by venue, position and line slot (the defense
  card's "1st goal" column, `firstGoals` in the defense API); games logged without it get it
  from the play-by-play via `stampFirstGoals` (`ingestGames` with nothing new, `?only=firstgoals`). The
  Matchups tab (`lib/nhl-data/slate.js`; each game drawn as two rinks in
  `components/nhl/Rink.jsx`, ice bands tinted by the opponent's SOG-allowed rank per position
  for the window picked above the rink — home / away / L5 / L10 / L5 home / L5 away, defaulting to
  tonight's venue —
  above each rink the opponent's PropFinder defense table (`propfinderDefenseTabs` in
  `lib/nhl-data/propfinder.js`, drawn by `PropfinderDefense` in `components/nhl/Propfinder.jsx`:
  All/C/LW/RW/D rows, season tabs then L5 / L10 / L15, per game or total, PropFinder's ranks, sortable),
  chips carrying the latest saved model run's λ shots / goals for the slate date from
  `lib/nhl-data/model-runs.js`, or a matchup read when no run exists; finished games show the
  box score; above each game's team verdicts a game-total read, `gameTotalRead` in
  `lib/nhl-data/verdict.js`: the stored meetings' totals blended with MoneyPuck's expected
  goals and pace, high / low half a goal either side of the league average) and the per-team defense card
  (`lib/nhl-data/defense.js`) are descriptive views over the stored rows; the model's
  own math stays in `NhlModel.jsx`. Logos/headshots are copied into `data/media/*` and
  served by `/api/nhl/data/media`; standings/leaders live in `data/league/*`.
- Lineups: `lib/nhl-data/gamedaytweets.js` reads the beat writers' lines from
  gamedaytweets.com/lines?team=XXX (roster-aware name matching) for every slate team; a
  game-day tweet beats the NHL.com preview, otherwise the preview, then an older tweet, then
  the roster; "game-day" is decided by timestamp (tweet id vs the preview's updated time).
  gamedaytweets.com challenges cloud addresses (Cloudflare "Just a moment": Render and the GitHub
  runner alike), so its pages are fetched elsewhere and posted: the Mac sync (`tools/mac-sync/nhl-sync.sh`,
  hourly, sync token, multipart `date` + one file per team code) and both workflows via
  `tools/gdt-pages.sh` (plain curl, then `tools/gdt-browser.mjs` with Chrome through playwright-core), to
  `POST /api/nhl/data/lineups/gdt` (Bearer `NHL_ACTIONS_TOKEN`, a repo secret that must equal the
  Render env var; `authorize()` accepts it beside the stored sync token), where `ingestGdtPages`
  parses them against the rosters, merges (never erasing earlier lines), snapshots and auto-runs.
  Without a tweet or preview the snapshot uses PropFinder's depth chart (`propfinder-depth.json`).
  Slots a capture leaves empty (no lineup yet, or a partial one) are filled from the team's last
  known lineup (`data/lineups/last/<ABBR>.json`, written from each team's own capture) with
  players still on the roster, marked `carried`; the slate does the same for a game with no snapshot.
  `nhl-lineups.yml` re-reads lineups twice an hour 12:23–23:53 ET for games starting within 150 minutes
  (`only=lineups&due=150`), so every game is captured in its last hour;
  the Matchups tab's "Refresh lines" button does the same on demand and each rink shows when
  its source last changed. After every lineup capture (and every matchup-file import for a
  coming slate) `lib/nhl-data/autorun.js` runs the model on the server with the stored
  PropFinder workbooks + snapshot lineups + built history/home-away inputs and saves the run
  (source "auto", deduped by autoKey); the rink shows that run. The model's pure pipeline
  (parsers + `buildProjections`) lives in `components/nhl/model-core.js` so the server can import
  it; `NhlModel.jsx` keeps the UI and imports from it. Port logic changes into model-core.js.
- PropFinder API (`lib/nhl-data/propfinder-api.js`): with `PROPFINDER_EMAIL` / `PROPFINDER_PASSWORD`
  in the server env, `dailyRefresh` pulls the slate from api.propfinder.app each morning (and the
  hourly lineup reads pull when the slate's files are still missing): skater and team tables into
  `data/propfinder/*` and the season + L5 matchup workbooks through `ingestMatchupFile`, in the
  exports' exact layouts, then the auto run. Admin button and `POST /api/nhl/data/propfinder/pull`.
  Keep producing the CSV/workbook shapes the parsers already read; never adapt the parsers to the API.
- PropFinder CSV exports (skater per-game rates for the season or last N games, team stats for and
  against with ranks, opponent stats per position tagged by a `-lw/-c/-rw/-d` file-name suffix) are imported by
  `lib/nhl-data/propfinder.js` into `data/propfinder/*` (one snapshot per season; the
  bundled `lib/nhl-data/seed/propfinder-<year>.js` is the fallback, regenerated with
  `node tools/propfinder-seed.mjs <season> <csv…>`). They are descriptive views, not model
  inputs; the slate's defense edges fall back to the per-position opponent tables while a
  team has fewer than 10 stored games at a venue.
- MoneyPuck team metrics (`lib/nhl-data/moneypuck.js`, `data/moneypuck/*`) feed the team
  page, Matchups defense cards and League; credit MoneyPuck.com wherever shown.
- Theme: dark by default (`<html data-theme>`, toggle in the header, tokens in
  `globals.css`). `NhlModel.jsx` carries inline light colours, so it renders inside a
  `.nhlx-light` island; keep new UI on the tokens, never hard-coded tints.

## Design

- Design context, brand words, palette and type rules live in `.impeccable.md`; read it
  before any visual change. Tokens only (`globals.css`), no hard-coded tints, no nested
  cards, no gradient text, no side-stripe borders.

## Rules

- The model is admin-only (`NHL_ADMIN_EMAILS`). Every `/api/nhl/*` route must call `requireNhlAdmin()`.
- Keep the model's math untouched when restyling; port logic changes from the local app into
  `components/nhl/model-core.js` (pipeline) and `NhlModel.jsx` (UI).
- Secrets stay out of git (Render env + `.env.local`).
- Site is `noindex` by design (robots.txt disallow + X-Robots-Tag).
